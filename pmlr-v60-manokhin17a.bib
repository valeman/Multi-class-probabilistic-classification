  abstract = 	 {Inductive (IVAP) and cross (CVAP) Venn–Abers predictors are computationally efficient algorithms for probabilistic prediction in binary classification problems.
 We present a new approach to multi-class probability estimation by turning IVAPs and CVAPs into multi-class probabilistic predictors.
 The proposed multi-class predictors are experimentally more accurate than both uncalibrated predictors and existing calibration methods.}
